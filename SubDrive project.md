A  tool to accelarate the compling process of substrate based project.

#### Substract

With the of development of Polkadot and KUSAMA ,more and more peole are involved into the substrate ecosystem.Including developers who making their project on substrate and students or blockchain fans doing experiments on it.while the substrate framwork require a crucial compute source far beyond common users device.It usually takes hours to do the compile stuff.It's neither easy nor efficiency to compile the project for users,which keep many people out of this brand new field.

#### technic roadmap

a web based service

environment

automatic authentication

#### budget

- renting servers :10 severs well meet the requirements
|Amd |3950x| CPU
16core| 32threads
250G SSD |64G Memory
|bandwith:|xxxT
customized IP

- Deployment Optmize and maintaince
We will make a series of automatic scripts to fit the compiling workflow.
Monitor the severs,optimize the sever performance,disaster backu to provide stable and convinient service.
A web-based interface will be provided for users to register and get access to the tool.

- User community maintaince
we will get reach to the users from the rust community, Polkadot community, KUSAMA community,
and provide guidance docs and online communication through Discord, Telegram, Wechat,etc to insure more people make best use of this tool.
